	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
				<p>This is my personal website where I aim to present data science projects.</p>
	
	<h2>Recent Projects</h2>
		<h3>Trump’s treatment in the Opinion Section of the NYTimes</h3>
		<p>Performed sentiment analysis on over 700 Op-Eds written between 2017 and 2018 and the corresponding 300,000 comments, 
		finding that comments relating to Trump are significantly more negative than those not relating to him. </p>
	
		<h3>Wikipedia Talk pages: toxic and obscene? </h3>
		<p>PUsed machine learning classifiers to differentiate between normal, toxic and obscene comments to build 3rd best classifier in class.</p>
	
		<h3>Who gets the Academy Award? </h3>
		<p>Exploratory data analysis with actor nominations for Academy Awards with a focus on data collection (web-scraping, APIs) and visualisation, 
			findings showing i.a. that women tend to be significantly younger than men at the peak of their career.</p>
	
		<h3>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds: Is cheating contagious? </h3>
		<p>Created network simulations based on PlayerUnknown’s Battleground match data. Tested hypothesis that being killed by a 
			cheater makes someone more likely to cheat, with findings rejecting the hypothesis.</p>
